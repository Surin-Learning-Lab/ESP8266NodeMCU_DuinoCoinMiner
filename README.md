# ESP8266NodeMCU_DuinoCoinMiner
 Welcome to the GitHub repository for the ESP8266 NodeMCU project that integrates a TZT 1.77 inch color screen to display real-time Duino-Coin mining statistics. This project allows cryptocurrency enthusiasts to visually monitor vital mining metrics such as hash rate, difficulty, shares, and node status directly from their device.

Project Overview
This setup enhances the Duino-Coin mining operation by providing an interactive and informative display. It's designed for those interested in combining hardware interfacing, software development, and cryptocurrency mining into one engaging project.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
ESP8266 NodeMCU
TZT 1.77 inch color screen with ST7735 driver
Jumper wires
Arduino IDE installed on your computer
Installation
Download Mining Code:

Visit the Duino-Coin website, click on "Get Started," and set up an account.
Navigate to the 'Miners' section and download the ESP8266 mining code suitable for this project.
Hardware Setup:

Connect the TZT 1.77 inch screen to the ESP8266 NodeMCU following the wiring instructions provided in the guide.
Software Setup:

Install the Arduino IDE and add the necessary libraries (Adafruit ST7735 and Adafruit GFX).
Open the downloaded mining code and include the display functionality as detailed in the guide.
Configuration
Ensure that the display code correctly references the pins used on your ESP8266 NodeMCU.
Update the Wi-Fi credentials and other settings specific to your Duino-Coin account in the sketch.
Usage
Once everything is set up and the code is uploaded to your ESP8266:

Power on the ESP8266 NodeMCU.
The display will immediately begin to show real-time statistics about your mining operations.
Enjoy monitoring your Duino-Coin mining performance visually and in real-time!
